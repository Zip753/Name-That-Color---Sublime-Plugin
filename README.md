# Name That Color - Sublime Text Plugin

A Sublime plugin to transform the selected hex color into a friendly name. Basically, a Python port of Chirag Mehta's [ntc.js](http://chir.ag/projects/ntc/) wrapped in a Sublime Text 2/3 command. 

## Installation

Download and drop the directory into Sublime's `packages` directory.

## Usage

Select a hex color and run the `Name That Color: Name Selected Hex Color` from the command palette. 

## Credits

All credit goes to [Chirag Mehta](http://chir.ag/projects/ntc/), I didn't do much other than translate to Python.
